Have you ever wondered why words like ‘through,’ ‘though,’ and ‘thought’ sound so different despite their similar spelling? The answer lies in phonemes, the building blocks of spoken language. This article explains what the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and phonemes are.

## What are phonemes?

Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that can distinguish words. For instance, the words ‘bat’ and ‘pat’ differ by a single phoneme: /b/ versus /p/. Phonemes are crucial in learning pronunciation, understanding accents, and studying linguistics.

## What is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)?

The IPA is a standardized system of symbols created by linguists to represent the sounds of spoken languages. It allows anyone, regardless of their native language, to pronounce words accurately. For example, the English word ‘cat’ is transcribed in IPA as /kæt/. The IPA is used for all languages, not just English, making it a powerful tool for linguistic study.

IPA symbols enclosed with slashes represent phonemes. So /b/, /p/ and /k/ are all phonemes. And it's not really difficult to guess their corresponding sounds. But what about /æ/? The total number of sounds in IPA exceeds the number of English alphabets. Therefore, some IPA symbols might look infamiliar to you. <a href="https://www.ipachart.com">This website</a> lets you hear the sounds of IPA.

## English phonemes and their IPA representations

So, how many phonemes are there in English?

### Consonants

<Table
  data={{
    headers: [
      "",
      "Bilabial",
      "Labiodental",
      "dental",
      "Alveolar",
      "Post-alveolar",
      "Palatal",
      "Velar",
      "Glottal",
    ],
    rows: [
      ["Plosive", "p, b ", "", "", "t, d", "", "", "k, g", "ʔ"],
      ["Nasal", "m", "", "", "n", "", "", "ŋ", ""],
      ["Flap", "", "", "", "ɾ", "", "", "", ""],
      ["Fricative", "", "f, v", "θ, ð", "s, z", "ʃ, ʒ", "", "", "h"],
      ["Affricate", "", "", "", "", "t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ", "", "", ""],
      ["Approximant", "w", "", "", "ɹ, l", "", "j", "", ""],
    ],
  }}
/>

- Single symbols are voiced,
  except for the glottal sounds.

### Vowels

You can think of monophthongs and diphthongs as a single vowel and double vowels.

#### Monophthongs

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["", "Front", "Central", "Back"],
    rows: [
      ["High", "i, ɪ", "", "ʊ, u"],
      ["Mid", "(e), ɛ", "ə", "(o)"],
      ["Low", "æ, (a)", "", "ɑ"],
    ],
  }}
/>

- a, e, o only appear in the diphthongs.

#### Diphthongs

aɪ, aʊ, eɪ, oɪ, oʊ

## Conclusion

By understanding phonemes and the IPA, you’ll unlock the mysteries of English pronunciation and gain a deeper appreciation for the nuances of language.
